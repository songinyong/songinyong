# Hi there, I'm Inyong Song 👋

## 🎓 About Me
**MS Graduate** (Feb 2025) from **GIST AI Graduate School** | **NetAI Lab**  
Currently refining research outcomes and awaiting publication review  
Specializing in **Cloud-Native Digital Twin Services** and **DT base Simultaion**

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical cloud-native implementations. My work focuses on developing scalable, containerized solutions for digital twin environments using Omniverse, Isaac Sim, and Kubernetes. Currently finalizing my research contributions while exploring new opportunities in the industry.

## 🔬 Research Focus
- **Digital Twin Implementation**: Developed cloud-native microservices architecture for GIST AI Graduate School space
- **Simulation & Reality Bridge**: Contarized Isaac Sim + ROS2 integration for real-world applications
- **Cloud-native based AI service**: Implementing Multi-camera Camera-based human localization and tracking systems (Falcon)
- **Edge Computing**: I supporing MobileX environment resource sharing and optimization
